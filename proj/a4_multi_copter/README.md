## Programming Assignment 04: Multi Copter

## Student: Amittai Wekesa

&nbsp;

For this assignment, I implemented linear-motion and angular-motion equations discussed in class, and altitude control for a multi-rotor copter.

i then added custom targets to allow the copter navigate through a sequence of obstacles.

To achieve that, I modified `MultiCopterDriver.h` to add custom target points. All the other changes went into `MultiCopter.h`.
